# Moodle 3.x Developer's Guide
This is the code repository for [Moodle 3.x Developer's Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/moodle-3x-developers-guide?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786467119), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
The new and revamped Moodle is the top choice for developers to create cutting edge e-learning environments that cater to different market sectors, with learning that is engaging and is visually appealing as well.

This book explains how the Moodle 3.x platform provides a framework that allows developers to create a fully customized and tailored e-learning solution. It begins with an exploration of the different types of plugin that are available for Moodle, and you will learn which plugin is the best solution for which particular problem.

We then continue with an investigation of how new courses can be created and managed by custom plugins. You will see how custom resource and activity modules can be developed to provide novel e-learning interactions. Then, once courses have been made available on the platform, you’ll learn how users can be assigned to courses and granted the necessary permissions—all through the development of new authentication and enrollment plugins.

Furthermore, you will develop a custom user home page using the ‘Dashboard’ feature together with the creation of custom blocks. At the end of the book, we’ll discuss the Web Services API to provide custom external APIs that you can use to fully automate Moodle 3.x in real time.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter04.



The code will look like the following:
```
  public function __construct($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2) { 
 
        $this->radius = 6378100; // Meters. 
        $this->distance = $this->get_distance($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2); 
    } 
```
